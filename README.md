# PS2SaveIconResearch
Research on PS2 save icon formats and model display.
The end goal of this research is to:
* Create a tool that allows people to easily view and extract the icons.
* Create an archive of all PS2 icon models that can be viewed within the browser.

For this we need to be able to extract:
* The model geometry.
* Animation data.
* Texture data.

# TODO List:
1. ~~Make a way to view different icon modes (normal, copy, delete).~~
2. Understand/document the icon visual data format.
3. Find a way to extract that data to a format that can contain it (likely .FBX).
4. Find a way to publish a tool that does this that is cross-platform and allows people to do it easily.
5. Find a way to display that data within the browser and make it:
    * Textured.
    * Animated.
    * Rotateable/Zoomable.
6. Design website look/layout.
7. Create the website.
8. Generate publicity so the community can help build the archive.
