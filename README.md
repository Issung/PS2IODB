Welcome to the official repository for PS2IODB, or more fully, the PlayStation 2 Icon Open Database, this project has 2 goals: 
1. Provide a tool for people to easily extract PS2 save game icon assets. 
2. Provide a website for the community to contribute icon assets to, in order to fully archive all assets.

## Icon Extraction Tool
The first goal is attained by PS2IODB Extractor, a CLI/GUI Python tool that allows for manipulation of memory cards, importing and exporting saves, and extracting icon assets.

To learn more about the tool, how it works and how to improve it see [/extractor/README.md](extractor/README.md).

## Open Database Website
To achieve the second goal a React site has been built, which has a list of all PlayStation 2 titles, allows for browsing of them all, provides guides on how to contribute, and allows for interactive viewing of all assets directly in the browser.

To learn more about the website, how it works and how to improve it see [/website/README.md](website/README.md).

## Icon Contribution
For users that wish to contribute icons to the database, see the [Contribution Guide](https://ps2iodb.com/contribute).
