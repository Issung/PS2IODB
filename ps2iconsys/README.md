# PS2IconSys

Original website: https://www.ghulbus-inc.de/projects/ps2iconsys/index.html

This is a folder with all known resources for PS2IconSys by Ghulbus Inc.
This is a tool written in C++ that understands the icon.sys folder and can convert the ps2 icons to and from .obj files.
It also supports extracing the textures for the icons to .tga files.

It seems to be missing support for animations, though the viewer seems to display some info about frames and timings, but does not play the icons.
Also obviously obj files do not support animation data either.
